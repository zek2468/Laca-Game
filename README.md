#  LACA GAME

Laca-Game started by Lakewood game design class of 2017. However, it was never finished now with two of the original sophomores and all new developers. Can the game design class of 2019 finish the game? (Short answer no) Long answer: We tried and added our own twist to it. With even more dungeons, A fully finished script (That may have gotten lost), And even a dramatic end scene that will leave you wanting more.
